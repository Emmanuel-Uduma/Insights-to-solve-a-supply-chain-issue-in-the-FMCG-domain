# CLIFE Mart: Analysis

### INTRODUCTION
---

CLIFE Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Ogun, Nigeria. It is currently operational in three cities Lagos, Port-Harcourt, and Ibadan. They want to expand to other metros/Tier 1 cities in the next two years.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT

CLIFE Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend their annual contracts due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products where either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continuous period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities, and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the 'On-Time' and 'In-Full' delivery service level for all the customer's daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to this issue.

They supply chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure 'On-Time' delivery (OT)%, 'In-Full' delivery (IF)%, and 'On-Time & In-Full' (OTIF)% of the customer orders on daily basis against the target service level set for each customers.

I am a Data Analyst in the supply chain team, who joined CLIFE Mart recently, and have been briefed about the task in stakeholders business review meeting. I am to build a dashboard and perform the following task;

	ðŸŽ» Create the metrics according to the metric list
	ðŸŽ» Create relevant insights not provided in the metric list
	ðŸŽ» Relevant business knowledge and explanations
	ðŸŽ» Meta data
	ðŸŽ» Note taken during the stakeholders meeting

### Skills Demonstrated
- DAX concepts
- Calculated column
- Filtered Data
- Created relationships between the various datasets.

### DATA SOURCING

I downloaded the dataset through the Octave Analysis slack channel where this challenge was thrown to us to generate meaningful insights from the dataset.

### DATA TRANSFORMATION

I transformed the dataset by importing it into Ms Power BI, where I cleaned the dataset, inserted necessary columns to view the data efficiently.

### MODELLING

Importing the dataset into Power BI created a relationship between the various datasets, which I carefully looked on, and made some changes to the relationship of the datasets.

### ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATIONS

As a newly recruited Data Analyst in the supply chain team, I was able to find solutions to the challenges by using a metric list to follow through.

Also, due to the need for results in the company, the shareholders came together to project the next move. And with that, they make a sketch of the KPIs needed.

Furthermore, after analysing the dataset, I observed that there was a massible decline in the total number of orders in the month of August, which was as a result of the decrease in the orders that arrived On-Time and In-Full. So, I created a dashboard to represent my observations to the stakeholders.

### CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS

From the dashboard above, we can see it clearly that the orders In-Full were just a little above the average when compared to the company's target, the same with the orders delivered On-Time. Which is a very bad reputation for the company.
Also, the orders which were delivered On-Time and In-Full were way too below average, which is the major cause of the decline in the number of orders.

Hence, I will recommend that the stakeholders see to the duties of their various departments tpo make sure that the goods produced are delivered On-Time and In-Full.
